Welcome to **Little Big Top Aerial**!

We are a nonprofit organization empowering youth and adults through the transformative art of aerial performance. Our mission is to build confidence, creativity, and community—one performance at a time.
Little Big Top Boise is a youth-led nonprofit circus arts troupe based in the Treasure Valley. Founded by a passionate group of young performers—including our daughter, who has trained in aerial arts for over five years—our mission is to bring wonder, joy, and creativity to our community through live performance. Our talented troupe specializes in trapeze, aerial silks, and lyra, and brings extra flair with unicycling, juggling, and balloon artistry. We perform at private events, festivals, and community gatherings, blending classic circus magic with fresh, youthful energy.

More than just a performance group, Little Big Top Boise is a platform for young artists to build confidence, discipline, and connection through circus arts. As a nonprofit, we’re proud to offer accessible performances and partner with schools, local organizations, and sponsors who believe in the power of arts to uplift and inspire. Whether you’re booking a show or looking to support local talent, we invite you to join us under the Little Big Top.
