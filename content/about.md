Welcome to the **Little Big Top Boise**!

Little Big Top Boise is a nonprofit, based in Boise, Idaho. We support youth pursuing circus arts. Student athletes focus on trapeze, aerial silks, lyra, and bring extra pizzazz with unicycling, juggling, and balloon artistry. Athletes are competition focused, but also perform at private events, and community gatherings – blending classic circus magic with fresh, youthful energy.

Our mission is to instill confidence, creativity and community in our student athletes – all while bringing joy and entertainment to the world around us.
